This repository contains a simple Python function demonstrating a common runtime error, ZeroDivisionError, that can arise unexpectedly. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` calculates the reciprocal of a number, leading to a division by zero error when the input is 0.  The solution file provides a robust implementation that avoids this error by handling the exceptional case.

The files are:
* bug.py: The initial buggy code.
* bugSolution.py: The corrected version with error handling.
